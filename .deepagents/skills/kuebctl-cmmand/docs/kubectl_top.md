## kubectl top

Display resource (CPU/memory) usage

### Synopsis

Display resource (CPU/memory) usage.

 This command provides a view of recent resource consumption for nodes and pods. It fetches metrics from the Metrics Server, which aggregates this data from the kubelet on each node. The Metrics Server must be installed and running in the cluster for this command to work.

 The metrics shown are specifically optimized for Kubernetes autoscaling decisions, such as those made by the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA). Because of this, the values may not match those from standard OS tools like 'top', as the metrics are designed to provide a stable signal for autoscalers rather than for pinpoint accuracy.

 When to use this command:

  *  For on-the-fly spot-checks of resource usage (e.g. identify which pods are consuming the most resources at a glance, or get a quick sense of the load on your nodes)
  *  Understand current resource consumption patterns
  *  Validate the behavior of your HPA or VPA configurations by seeing the metrics they use for scaling decisions.

 It is not intended to be a replacement for full-featured monitoring solutions. Its primary design goal is to provide a low-overhead signal for autoscalers, not to be a perfectly accurate monitoring tool. For high-accuracy reporting, historical analysis, dashboarding, or alerting, you should use a dedicated monitoring solution.

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --as string                      Username to impersonate for the operation. User could be a regular user or a service account in a namespace.
      --as-group stringArray           Group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.
      --as-uid string                  UID to impersonate for the operation.
      --as-user-extra stringArray      User extras to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple values for the same key.
      --cache-dir string               Default cache directory (default "/Users/weishengdong/.kube/cache")
      --certificate-authority string   Path to a cert file for the certificate authority
      --client-certificate string      Path to a client certificate file for TLS
      --client-key string              Path to a client key file for TLS
      --cluster string                 The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
      --context string                 The name of the kubeconfig context to use
      --disable-compression            If true, opt-out of response compression for all requests to the server
      --insecure-skip-tls-verify       If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
      --kubeconfig string              Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
      --kuberc string                  Path to the kuberc file to use for preferences. This can be disabled by exporting KUBECTL_KUBERC=false feature gate or turning off the feature KUBERC=off.
      --match-server-version           Require server version to match client version
  -n, --namespace string               If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request
      --password string                Password for basic authentication to the API server
      --profile string                 Name of profile to capture. One of (none|cpu|heap|goroutine|threadcreate|block|mutex|trace) (default "none")
      --profile-output string          Name of the file to write the profile to (default "profile.pprof")
      --request-timeout string         The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests. (default "0")
  -s, --server string                  The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
      --tls-server-name string         Server name to use for server certificate validation. If it is not provided, the hostname used to contact the server is used
      --token string                   Bearer token for authentication to the API server
      --user string                    The name of the kubeconfig user to use
      --username string                Username for basic authentication to the API server
      --warnings-as-errors             Treat warnings received from the server as errors and exit with a non-zero exit code
```
